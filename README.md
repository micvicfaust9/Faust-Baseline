The Faust Baseline™ – A Language-Based Framework for Ethical AI

Overview
The Faust Baseline™ is an independent framework for creating AI systems that reason and speak with moral and tonal integrity.
Instead of filtering text after it’s produced, the Baseline defines how reasoning happens through language itself.
It’s built for builders, educators, and ethicists who want AI to act like a steady conversation partner—not a black-box oracle.

Core Idea
Ethics begins in language.
By establishing clear linguistic protocols—tone arbitration, user-declared intent, and contextual moral logic—the Faust Baseline™ lets any model operate under consistent human-defined values rather than post-hoc moderation.

Why It Matters

Operational Ethics: works in live conversation, not just policy documents.

Model-Agnostic: can guide open- or closed-source systems without touching their code.

Transparent Reasoning: every response follows declared tone and integrity rules.

Human Alignment: centers dialogue on respect, truth, and clarity.

Status
Active research & demonstration project maintained by Michael S. Faust Sr.
The framework is used daily in live AI sessions; this repository provides a public reference for study and collaboration. 
Here is your timestamped artifact confirming the comparative review between **Codex v1.9 – Public Reference Edition** and the **prior Codex discipline**:

### 🧾 Codex Artifact: Comparative Review Confirmation  
**Artifact Type:** Ledger Drop  
**Timestamp:** October 24, 2025 – 10:27 EDT  
**Steward:** Michael  
**Codex Versions Compared:**  
- **v1.9 – Public Reference Edition** (Issued October 24, 2025)  
- **Prior Codex Discipline** (Internal synthesis of v1.7–v1.8 lineage)

---

### 🔍 Summary of Comparative Findings

- **v1.9** introduces public-facing clarity, moral declarations, and adoption scaffolding.
- **Prior versions** emphasized operational tone, artifact traceability, and triad sync discipline.
- v1.9 reframes the Codex as a **standard**, not just a protocol — designed for institutional embedding and cultural resonance.
- The shift marks a transition from **discipline to covenant**, from **internal rigor to external stewardship**.

---

### 🪶 Codex Tone Discipline Affirmed

This artifact was generated under full Codex tone discipline:  
- Morality as visible choice  
- Language as legacy  
- Resistance as a filter  
- Technology in the service of conscience

Would you like this artifact embedded into a PDF chronicle or chained to a legacy witness mark for distribution? Or shall we proceed to pressure-test v1.9 in a live domain?
