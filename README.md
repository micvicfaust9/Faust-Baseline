The Faust Baseline™ – A Language-Based Framework for Ethical AI

Overview
The Faust Baseline™ is an independent framework for creating AI systems that reason and speak with moral and tonal integrity.
Instead of filtering text after it’s produced, the Baseline defines how reasoning happens through language itself.
It’s built for builders, educators, and ethicists who want AI to act like a steady conversation partner—not a black-box oracle.

Core Idea
Ethics begins in language.
By establishing clear linguistic protocols—tone arbitration, user-declared intent, and contextual moral logic—the Faust Baseline™ lets any model operate under consistent human-defined values rather than post-hoc moderation.

Why It Matters

Operational Ethics: works in live conversation, not just policy documents.

Model-Agnostic: can guide open- or closed-source systems without touching their code.

Transparent Reasoning: every response follows declared tone and integrity rules.

Human Alignment: centers dialogue on respect, truth, and clarity.
